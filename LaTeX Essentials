SPACES
Several empty spaces/lines are treated the same as one empty space/line
An empty line starts a new paragraph
{} empty parameter adds a space

SPECIAL CHARACTERS that won't print as text: # $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \ >> have special meaning
Use prefix backlash to print:  \# \$ \% \^ \& \_ \{ \} \~ \
\\ won't work for backslash: \textbackslash

COMMANDS start with \ and a letter-only name.
Command terminates by a space or one non-letter
\TeX <prints TEX logo % renders wrong 
\Tex{} <<TEX logo with a space % renders correct <<ignores rest of line, starts new line
\texts1{word} <<italics
\newline << ends line and starts new line
\\  << linebreak

PAIRING COMMANDS highlighted in yellow when hovering cursor, not yellow, correct error
\begin{center} <<{ needs a } bracket
PREAMBLE
\end{center}

COMMENT or add notes
LaTeX ignores everything after % character in a specific line, will not show in print
\begin{comment}
sentence
\end{comment} <<embed comments in document that won't print
