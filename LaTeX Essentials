SPACES
Several empty spaces/lines are treated the same as one empty space/line
An empty line starts a new paragraph
{} empty parameter adds a space

SPECIAL CHARACTERS that won't print as text: # $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \ >> have special meaning
Use prefix backlash to print:  \# \$ \% \^ \& \_ \{ \} \~ \
\\ won't work for backslash: \textbackslash
Don't use the " for quotation marks. Use 2 single ''s
``Please press the `x' key.''  <<Example

COMMANDS start with \ and a letter-only name.
Command terminates by a space or one non-letter
\today <<current date
\TeX <<prints TEX logo % renders wrong 
\Tex{} <<TEX logo with a space % renders correct <<ignores rest of line, starts new line
\LaTeX
\texts1{word} <<italics
\newline << ends line and starts new line without starting a new paragraph
\\  << linebreak, same as above
\\*  <<prohibits a page break after a forced line break
\newpage <<starts new page

PAIRING COMMANDS highlighted in yellow when hovering cursor, not yellow, correct error
\begin{center} <<{ needs a } bracket
PREAMBLE
\end{center}

COMMENT or add notes
LaTeX ignores everything after % character in a specific line, will not show in print
\begin{comment}
sentence
\end{comment} <<embed comments in document that won't print

IDENTIFY ERRORS
first open line after error turns pink
with red dot and white minus sign
Clicking on error in Error tab takes you to the pink line with the error

SET UP DOCUMENT
\documentclass{article}    %Can be book, thesis etc.
  (PREAMBLE)  <<Paragraph style, font size, letter size,  etc.
\begin{document}   << text begins here
  (TEXT)  << body of ducument (text) that will print
\end{document}   <<text ends here

How the PARAGRAPHS are typeset depends on the document class.
Normally the first line of a paragraph is indented, and there is no additional space between two paragraphs.
\usepackage{parskip}  << Paragraph style with no indentation and an open line between paragraphs
\documentclass[options]{style}
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}  << command options in preamble always in [] brackets
The geometry package enables the user to set page layout details for a document, such as 
margins, position of headers and footers, text height and width.
\usepackage[margins=3.5cm]{geometry}

CREATE NEW COMMANDS
\newcommand{\np}{\newpage} <<create abbreviation for New Page command

Ensure numbers are correct by using , as decimal without a space after
\DeclareMathSymbol{,}{\mathord}{letters}{"3B}

EXAMPLE
\documentclass{article} <<current date added automatically to article
\usepackage{parskip} % paragraph style
\usepackage[margin=3.5cm]{geometry} %page layout
\DeclareMathSymbol{,}{\mathord}{letters}{"3B} %decimal comma
\newcommand{\np}{\newpage}

\begin{document}
\title{DSC4830\\[3mm] %module code <<\\ seperate new lines and [] specifies space
      Research project \\[5mm] %module name
      Department of Decision Sciences\\[1cm] %department name
      Assignment 1\\[5mm] %first assignment
      Typing in \LaTeX\\[1cm] %title (choose yourself)
      } << end of title
\author{\textbf{\Large John Smith}\\[3mm] %Your name and surname
       \textbf{\Large 12345678} %your student number
       }
  \maketitle <<Command after title and author for a title page
\thispagestyle{empty} <<No page number for title only <<Command rigt before/after \maketitle command
\np <<from preamble, ensures only title appears on first page
\end{document}

PAGE NUMBERING
\pagenumbering{roman} <<for Introduction then change to
\pagenumbering{arabic} \setcounter{page}{1} <<for the main part of the document

TABLE OF CONTENTS
\tableofcontents <<with \newpage before and after

SECTIONS
\section{Introduction} <numbered
\section*{Heading} <unnumbered
...sentence
\subsection{Important Commands} <numbered i.e.1.1
The commands are \verb|abc <\verb| prints bold

BIBLIOGRAPHY not included in TOC.
Use tocbibind package to add additional TOC objects
Remove the Options using codes:
bibliography = notbib
index = notindex
table of contents = nottoc
list of figures = notlof
list of tables = notlot
\usepackage[notlof,notlot]{tocbibind} <TOC without list of figures and tables

INDEX alphabetical list of words that occur in the documet
Activate makeidx or imakeidx package
enter \index{word} instead of the word in the sentence, remember LaTeX is case sensitive
\printindex <where index should appear at end of doc

LINE BREAK & PAGE BREAK
\newline << ends line and starts new line without starting a new paragraph
\\  << linebreak, same as above
\\*  <<prohibits a page break after a forced line break
\newpage <<starts new page
\linebreak[n], \nolinebreak[n] <<suggest places where a break may (or may not) happen - 0<n<4
\pagebreak[n], \nopagebreak[n] <<suggest places where a break may (or may not) happen

HYPHENATION
\sloppy <<Lower hyphenating standards
\fussy  <<set back to default standards
\hyphenation{FORTRAN Hy-phen-a-tion} <<mark hyphenation points for specific words - Fortration can't be hypenated
\- inserts a discretionary hyphen into a word:
I think this is: su\-per\-cal\-i\-frag\-i\-lis\-tic\-ex\-pi\-al\-i\-do\-cious
\mbox{0116 291 2319}  <<always print together
\mbox{\emph{filename}}  <<together in italics
\fbox{} <<visible box around content
