SPACES
Several empty spaces/lines are treated the same as one empty space/line
An empty line starts a new paragraph
{} empty parameter adds a space

SPECIAL CHARACTERS that won't print as text: # $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \ >> have special meaning
Use prefix backlash to print:  \# \$ \% \^ \& \_ \{ \} \~ \
\\ won't work for backslash: \textbackslash

COMMANDS start with \ and a letter-only name.
Command terminates by a space or one non-letter
\TeX <prints TEX logo % renders wrong 
\Tex{} <<TEX logo with a space % renders correct <<ignores rest of line, starts new line
\texts1{word} <<italics
\newline << ends line and starts new line

PAIRING COMMANDS highlighted in yellow when hovering cursor, not yellow, correct error
\begin{center} <<{ needs a } bracket
PREAMBLE
\end{center}

COMMENT or add notes
LaTeX ignores everything after % character in a specific line, will not show in print
\begin{comment}
sentence
\end{comment} <<embed comments in document that won't print

IDENTIFY ERRORS
first open line after error turns pink
with red dot and white minus sign
Clicking on error in Error tab takes you to the pink line with the error
